# Welcome to my blog
My name is Rasvitha Rajendra and here is some info about me...
I am a junior that attends East Brunswick Highschool. I partcipate in Marching Band, Exec Board of Psychology Club, National Honors Society, and volunteer at the local youth council, and at the Emergency Department of CentraState Hospital. My interests include playing the saxophone, doing classical indian dance, and doing makeup. I want to go into the field of Psychology when I grow up and my dream is to become a criminal profiler.
