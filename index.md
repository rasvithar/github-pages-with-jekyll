# Welcome to my blog
My name is Rasvitha Rajendra and here is some info about me.
I am a junior that attends East Brunswick Highschool. My interests include playing the saxophone, doing classical indian dance, and doing makeup. I want to go into the field of Psychology when I grow up and my dream is to become a criminal profiler. These are just a few things about me, but you'll get to know more in my blog.

I attended Pscyh club in 10th grade, got on the Exec. Board in 11th as Public Relations and now am applying for President. I am a volunteer at the youth council, provide extra classes for younger students at my dance academy and have been a volunteer at the Emergency Department of CentraState Hospital for two years now.
