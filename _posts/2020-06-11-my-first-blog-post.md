Hey guys, this is my first post. So far everything has been pretty good. Quarintine has finally been lifted so my family is planning
a beach vacation ot ocean city in a couple of weeks. School's almost out so I have to finish pending assignmnets and brag sheets so 
that I'll be ready for summer. But it won't all be fun and games because I have ACT's and SAT's coming up, but other than that I can't
wait for summer to start. I'll be posting soon, see you all later!
